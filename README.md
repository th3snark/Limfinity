# Limfinity
An example Limfinity API Service implemented as a .NET Standard Class Library

* This repo is supplied as a real world example for those wishing to understand the Limfinity API.

* The **com.cbctc.Service.Limfinity** is supplied for reference only. It is **not** intended to build. If a full build copy is required then the missing references to the Plate library (not supplied here) is required.

### Extra Solution Items

* **Postman Exports** contains a Postman collection and environment that provide further examples. You just supply your own server names, usernames and passwords where appropriate.

* **Limfinity API Scripts** contains several example Limfinity scripts that are callable from the Limfinity API. They need to be installed as "Helper Scripts" and the "Enable via API" checkbox should be set on.
